### 2. Attacker Story Script (150-200 Words)

**Narration for Presentation:**

In November 2025, a decentralized hacktivist collective called Echo Strike launched Operation Digital Justice against TechFlow Industries, a fictional corporation accused of environmental crimes and whistleblower suppression. Their motive was clear: expose corporate wrongdoing and force accountability through digital disruption.

The operation unfolded in three calculated phases. During reconnaissance, Echo Strike spent three weeks gathering intelligence through social media, open-source research, and social engineering tactics targeting employees. They identified vulnerabilities in TechFlow's infrastructure and mapped their digital landscape.

In the delivery phase, the collective launched sophisticated phishing campaigns and exploited an unpatched VPN gateway to gain initial access. Once inside, they established persistence and began exfiltrating sensitive data.

The final impact phase was devastating. Echo Strike leaked fifteen thousand internal documents exposing environmental violations, launched a massive DDoS attack that took down TechFlow's website for three hours, and coordinated a viral social media campaign that reached millions worldwide.

The defender countermeasures displayed on this site—DDoS protection, security monitoring, employee training, strong access controls, and aggressive patch management—represent essential defenses against hacktivist threats. These groups prioritize visibility and disruption, making proactive security and rapid incident response critical for any organization.
